# React Practice

This repository comprises 3 small react projects for the Web Development course instructed by [Parham Alvani](https://github.com/1995parham).

### 1st Program:
First program is a counter which can count up/down using a button and pause/start. Also, you can reset the counter. see the gif below:

### 2nd Program:
The purpose of this program was to use ‍‍`jasonPlaceholder` and show the data and use `PropTypes`. Also, there is a pause before loading the data to show a loading gif.
